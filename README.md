This repo I made to learn the syntax of golang. The repo is based on the book "Introducing go" by Caleb Doxsey and is divided into subdirectories called chapters which are based on the chapters of the book.
The repo includes most algorithms in the book(including the practice exercises) in which I have my own implementation of the solutions that anyone is free to copy
